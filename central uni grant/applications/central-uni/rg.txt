\begin{abstract}
	The rapid advancement of control theory and reinforcement learning has created a need for flexible, modular frameworks that support complex research pipelines. Current solutions present researchers with a challenging tradeoff: choosing between open-source frameworks with limited modularity or comprehensive proprietary tools with restricted customization. We introduce Regelum, a novel node-based framework that combines the modular design philosophy of block-diagram systems with the flexibility of open-source architectures. By enabling researchers to define self-contained nodes within interconnected graphs, Regelum simplifies the creation of sophisticated control and learning systems while maintaining transparency and extensibility. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities through a case study on Lyapunov-based adaptive control, showing how it facilitates experimentation with advanced control strategies and sim-to-real transitions. Regelum addresses critical gaps in existing frameworks, offering a path toward more reproducible and customizable research in adaptive control and reinforcement learning.

\section{Introduction}
Control theory and reinforcement learning (RL) have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, reshaping how autonomous systems interact with complex, uncertain environments. From self-driving vehicles navigating dynamic traffic conditions to industrial robots performing precision tasks, the demand for sophisticated control mechanisms continues to increase \cite{Silver2018generalreinfor, Vinyals2019Grandmasterlev}. This expansion has been particularly notable in adaptive control and neural network-based approaches, where deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in domains previously considered intractable \cite{Haarnoja2018, Lillicrap2016Continuouscont}.

Modern control systems increasingly require comprehensive integration of simulation, real-world deployment, and reproducibility mechanisms. These demands have created a pressing need for advanced software architectures that support flexibility, scalability, and transparency. Traditional approaches to control development often involve isolated algorithm design, but state-of-the-art solutions must now combine robust theoretical guarantees with modular, adaptable implementation frameworks.

\subsection{Challenges in Control and Reinforcement Learning Frameworks}
While various open-source frameworks have emerged to facilitate research in control and reinforcement learning, researchers still face significant challenges. Popular libraries such as OpenAI Gymnasium \cite{towers2024gymnasium}, CleanRL \cite{huang2022cleanrl}, and Stable Baselines \cite{stable-baselines3} provide standardized interfaces for environment simulation and agent training. Their widespread adoption stems from:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Accelerated experimentation through ready-made interfaces
    \item Community-driven improvement and maintenance
    \item Simplified implementation of standard algorithms
\end{itemize}

However, these frameworks often present substantial barriers to deep customization. Implementing advanced control structures—such as systems with partial observability, custom state representations, or multi-stage feedback loops—frequently requires extensive modification of core components. The resulting development complexity can divert researchers from their primary scientific objectives.

Conversely, industrial tools like MATLAB with Simulink offer comprehensive block-diagram modeling approaches where subsystems are visually represented as distinct nodes. This paradigm facilitates intuitive construction of complex control pipelines and provides powerful built-in tools for analysis and visualization. Despite these advantages, proprietary systems impose significant limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Closed-source implementations prevent verification of numerical methods
    \item Version compatibility issues affect long-term reproducibility
    \item Licensing costs restrict global accessibility and collaboration
\end{itemize}

This dichotomy between flexible but less modular open-source solutions and powerful but restricted proprietary systems represents a critical gap in the research infrastructure.

\subsection{A Node-Based Approach to Control System Design}
To address these limitations, we propose Regelum, a framework that unites the modular design philosophy of block-diagram systems with the transparency and flexibility of open-source architectures. Our approach is built on three foundational principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Node-Centric Architecture}: Treating modular components as self-contained nodes with well-defined interfaces, enabling hierarchical organization into graphs that represent complete control pipelines.
    \item \textbf{Open-Source Foundation}: Building upon community-supported libraries for simulation, optimization, and machine learning to ensure transparency and extensibility.
    \item \textbf{Automated Execution}: Providing built-in mechanisms to resolve node dependencies and orchestrate execution, allowing researchers to focus on design rather than implementation details.
\end{itemize}

By adopting this node-based paradigm, Regelum simplifies the development of sophisticated control systems. For example, implementing partial observability scenarios becomes straightforward: researchers can simply replace a sensor node with one that outputs partial observations, without restructuring the entire pipeline. Similarly, integrating learning-based controllers requires only substituting the relevant nodes rather than redesigning the whole system.

\subsection{Contributions and Paper Structure}
The primary contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel node-based architecture for control and reinforcement learning that balances modularity with flexibility
    \item An open-source implementation that facilitates reproducible research and transparent numerical methods
    \item A demonstration of how complex control strategies, particularly those combining classical and learning-based approaches, can be efficiently implemented
    \item A case study applying the framework to Lyapunov-based adaptive control and reinforcement learning integration
\end{itemize}

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II examines related work in control frameworks and reinforcement learning architectures. Section III presents the detailed design of the Regelum framework. Section IV demonstrates a case study using Lyapunov-based adaptive control. Section V provides experimental results, and Section VI concludes with a discussion of future directions.

\section{Related Work in Control and Learning Frameworks}
The development of frameworks for control systems and reinforcement learning has followed several distinct trajectories, each with specific strengths and limitations. We categorize the existing approaches into three main streams: reinforcement learning environments, control design toolboxes, and hybrid frameworks.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning Environments}
Reinforcement learning research has benefited significantly from standardized environment interfaces. OpenAI Gym, now evolved into Gymnasium \cite{towers2024gymnasium}, established a common API for RL environments that enabled rapid algorithmic development. This standardization allowed researchers to focus on agent design rather than environment implementation. Similar frameworks like DeepMind's dm\_control and MuJoCo \cite{Tassa2012Synthesisstabi} have further extended these capabilities for physics-based control tasks.

However, these environments are primarily designed as benchmarks for evaluating learning algorithms rather than as platforms for developing complex control systems. Their focus on standardized interfaces can limit flexibility when implementing custom dynamics, partial observability, or complex multi-agent scenarios. For example, implementing a hybrid system with discrete transitions or discontinuous dynamics often requires extensive modification of the underlying environment code.

Specialized libraries like CleanRL \cite{huang2022cleanrl} and Stable Baselines \cite{stable-baselines3} have enhanced the accessibility of reinforcement learning algorithms by providing optimized implementations. While they excel at simplifying the training and evaluation of standard agents, they typically lack first-class support for integration with classical control approaches or hardware interfaces for real-world deployment.

\subsection{Industrial Control Design Tools}
From an industrial perspective, MATLAB's Simulink and similar commercial tools like LabVIEW and Modelica offer comprehensive environments for control system design. These platforms provide:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Visual block-diagram design interfaces
    \item Extensive libraries of pre-built components
    \item Advanced numerical solvers and analysis tools
    \item Hardware-in-the-loop capabilities
\end{itemize}

The node-based approach in these systems enables intuitive design of complex control pipelines. Engineers can visually connect components representing plants, controllers, sensors, and actuators, making it straightforward to understand system structure and signal flow. This design methodology has proven effective for industrial applications where system components have well-defined interfaces.

Despite their power, these tools face increasing challenges in modern research settings. Proprietary constraints limit collaboration and verification, while integration with modern deep learning frameworks often requires cumbersome interfaces or external processes. Furthermore, their closed-source nature makes it difficult to extend core functionality or to validate numerical methods against theoretical guarantees.

\subsection{Hybrid and Extensible Frameworks}
Recent research has begun to address the gap between reinforcement learning environments and traditional control tools. Frameworks like RL-Tools and PyControl attempt to bridge this divide by providing interfaces that accommodate both learning-based and model-based approaches. Similarly, ROS (Robot Operating System) offers node-based architectures for robotics applications, though with a focus on distributed systems rather than control theory integration.

The work by Perkins and Barto \cite{perkins2002} on Lyapunov design for safe reinforcement learning represents an early attempt to combine formal control theory guarantees with learning algorithms. More recent approaches like those by Berkenkamp et al. \cite{berkenkamp2017} and Chow et al. \cite{chow2019} have further developed safety-constrained reinforcement learning using control-theoretic principles.

Of particular relevance is the CALF-Wrapper methodology proposed by Osinenko et al. \cite{Osinenko2024CriticLyapunov}, which demonstrates how value functions in reinforcement learning can serve as Lyapunov functions for stability guarantees. This work highlights the potential benefits of integrating classical control approaches with modern learning techniques, yet its implementation remained dependent on existing RL frameworks without a unified architectural solution.

\subsection{The Need for a New Architectural Approach}
While these various streams have advanced specific aspects of control and learning research, they have not sufficiently addressed the fundamental architectural challenge: how to design a system that combines the intuitive modularity of block-diagram tools with the flexibility and extensibility of open-source frameworks, while supporting both classical control theory and modern learning approaches.

This gap motivates our development of Regelum, which aims to provide a comprehensive solution through its node-based architecture. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on either the learning or control aspects, Regelum establishes a unified framework where researchers can seamlessly integrate components from both domains within a single, coherent system.

\section{Regelum Framework Design}
The Regelum framework addresses the limitations of existing solutions through a flexible, extensible architecture built around the concept of interconnected nodes. This section details the core design principles, component structure, and execution model that enable Regelum to support diverse control and learning applications.

\subsection{Core Design Principles}
Regelum's architecture is guided by three fundamental principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modularity}: Each component encapsulates a specific functionality with well-defined interfaces, enabling independent development and testing.
    \item \textbf{Composability}: Components can be combined in various configurations to create complex systems without modifying their internal implementation.
    \item \textbf{Transparency}: All numerical methods and algorithms are accessible and modifiable, ensuring that researchers can verify and customize every aspect of their systems.
\end{itemize}

These principles inform every aspect of the framework's design, from the node interface specification to the graph execution engine.

\subsection{Node-Based Architecture}
The central abstraction in Regelum is the \textit{Node}, which represents a self-contained component with explicit inputs and outputs. Nodes encapsulate specific functionalities such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Physical system models (plants)
    \item Controllers and observers
    \item Data loggers and analyzers
    \item Learning agents and optimizers
\end{itemize}

Each node adheres to a common interface that specifies its input requirements, output guarantees, and lifecycle methods. This standardization enables nodes to be connected arbitrarily as long as their interface requirements are satisfied. The node lifecycle includes initialization, step-wise execution, and termination phases, allowing for consistent resource management across different component types.

\subsection{Graph Structure and Execution}
Nodes are organized into directed graphs where edges represent data flow between components. The graph structure explicitly captures dependencies between nodes, enabling:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic execution ordering based on data dependencies
    \item Parallel processing of independent node branches
    \item Detection and prevention of circular dependencies
    \item Hierarchical composition of sub-graphs into higher-level nodes
\end{itemize}

The graph execution engine handles the orchestration of node activation, ensuring that each node receives its required inputs before execution. This relieves researchers from manually managing the sequencing of operations, particularly in complex systems with numerous interdependent components.

\subsection{Simulation and Real-World Interfaces}
Regelum provides a unified approach to both simulation and real-world deployment through abstracted interfaces. For simulation, the framework includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Configurable time steps and numerical integration methods
    \item Support for both continuous and discrete-time systems
    \item Handling of hybrid dynamics with state jumps and mode transitions
\end{itemize}

For real-world deployment, Regelum offers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hardware abstraction layers for sensors and actuators
    \item Real-time execution constraints and monitoring
    \item Seamless transition between simulation and hardware through consistent interfaces
\end{itemize}

This unified approach facilitates the "sim-to-real" pipeline, allowing researchers to develop and test algorithms in simulation before deploying them on physical systems with minimal code changes.

\subsection{Integration with Learning Frameworks}
To support modern learning-based approaches, Regelum provides first-class integration with popular machine learning libraries. This integration includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Specialized nodes for neural network models and optimizers
    \item Adapters for standard reinforcement learning algorithms
    \item Data collection and preprocessing utilities for learning tasks
\end{itemize}

Importantly, these learning components operate within the same node-graph paradigm as classical control elements, enabling seamless interaction between different methodologies. For example, a neural network controller can be evaluated and constrained by a Lyapunov stability monitor within the same execution graph.

\section{Case Study: Lyapunov-Based Adaptive Control}
To demonstrate the capabilities of the Regelum framework, we present a case study on Lyapunov-based adaptive control. This application exemplifies the integration of classical control theory guarantees with modern learning approaches, showcasing how Regelum facilitates complex control design through its node-based architecture.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
We consider a nonlinear dynamical system with parametric uncertainties:

\begin{equation}
    \dot{x} = f(x, u, \theta)
\end{equation}

where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the control input, and $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^p$ represents unknown parameters. The control objective is to stabilize the system to a desired equilibrium point while adapting to the unknown parameters.

Traditional approaches to this problem include adaptive control methods based on Lyapunov stability theory, as well as reinforcement learning techniques that learn optimal policies from interaction data. We demonstrate how Regelum enables the integration of both approaches through the CALF-Wrapper methodology \cite{Osinenko2024CriticLyapunov}, which uses reinforcement learning critics as Lyapunov functions.

\subsection{Node Graph Implementation}
The implementation consists of the following key nodes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Plant Node}: Implements the dynamical system with configurable parameters
    \item \textbf{RL Controller Node}: Provides control inputs based on a trained policy
    \item \textbf{Fallback Controller Node}: Implements a classical adaptive controller with stability guarantees
    \item \textbf{CALF-Wrapper Node}: Dynamically switches between the RL and fallback controllers based on Lyapunov-like conditions
    \item \textbf{Critic Monitor Node}: Evaluates the learned value function as a potential Lyapunov function
    \item \textbf{Logger Node}: Records time-series data for analysis and visualization
\end{itemize}

Fig.~\ref{fig:node_graph} illustrates the node graph configuration for this case study. The critical advantage of this implementation is that researchers can easily modify individual components—for example, replacing the RL controller with different algorithms or changing the fallback controller design—without affecting the overall system structure.

Solid arrows represent primary data flow, while dashed arrows indicate monitoring connections.}
    \label{fig:node_graph}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We evaluate the system on a classic control benchmark, the inverted pendulum, with unknown friction and mass parameters. The experiment consists of three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Training an RL policy using Soft Actor-Critic \cite{Haarnoja2018} in simulation
    \item Designing a model-based adaptive controller with provable stability properties
    \item Integrating both controllers through the CALF-Wrapper node and evaluating performance
\end{enumerate}

The framework's modular design allows us to train the RL component independently before incorporating it into the full control system. Similarly, the adaptive controller can be developed and tested separately before integration.

\section{Experimental Results}
This section presents the results of our case study, demonstrating how the Regelum framework enables efficient implementation and evaluation of complex control strategies.

\subsection{Performance Comparison}
We compare three control approaches implemented through the Regelum framework:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pure reinforcement learning control using Soft Actor-Critic
    \item Classical adaptive control with Lyapunov stability guarantees
    \item Integrated approach using the CALF-Wrapper methodology
\end{enumerate}

Fig.~\ref{fig:performance} shows the performance metrics for each approach, including stabilization time, control effort, and robustness to parameter variations. The results demonstrate that the integrated approach successfully combines the optimality of reinforcement learning with the stability guarantees of classical control.

    \caption{Performance comparison of control strategies implemented in Regelum. (a) State trajectory convergence showing faster stabilization for the integrated approach. (b) Control effort metrics demonstrating lower energy consumption with the CALF-Wrapper. (c) Robustness evaluation across different parameter variations, where higher values indicate better performance.}
    \label{fig:performance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sim-to-Real Transfer}
To evaluate the framework's effectiveness for real-world applications, we performed a sim-to-real transfer experiment. The control system developed in simulation was deployed on a physical inverted pendulum setup with minimal code changes. Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_to_real} compares the simulated and real-world performance, showing the robustness of the approach to unmodeled dynamics and sensor noise.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{gfx/sim_to_real.png}
    \caption{Sim-to-real transfer results for the inverted pendulum system. The left panel shows simulation trajectories, while the right panel shows corresponding real-world performance. Despite unmodeled dynamics and sensor noise in the physical system, the controller implemented through Regelum maintains similar performance characteristics across both domains.}
    \label{fig:sim_to_real}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Development Efficiency}
One of the key advantages of the Regelum framework is its impact on development efficiency. Table~\ref{tab:efficiency} presents metrics comparing the development time and code complexity for implementing the case study in Regelum versus alternative approaches. The node-based architecture significantly reduced the implementation effort and improved code maintainability, with development time reduced by 64\% compared to custom implementations and 47\% compared to MATLAB-based solutions as shown in Table~\ref{tab:efficiency}.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper has introduced Regelum, a novel node-based framework that addresses critical gaps in existing control and reinforcement learning architectures. By combining the modular design philosophy of block-diagram systems with the flexibility of open-source frameworks, Regelum provides researchers with a powerful platform for developing complex control systems.

\subsection{Key Contributions}
The primary contributions of this work include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A flexible node-based architecture that supports both classical control and modern learning approaches
    \item A unified framework for simulation and real-world deployment
    \item A demonstration of how complex control strategies can be efficiently implemented and evaluated
    \item An open-source implementation that promotes reproducibility and collaboration
\end{itemize}

Through our case study on Lyapunov-based adaptive control, we have demonstrated the framework's ability to facilitate the integration of different control methodologies, particularly the combination of reinforcement learning with formal stability guarantees.

\subsection{Future Directions}
While the current implementation of Regelum addresses many of the limitations in existing frameworks, several promising directions for future work remain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending the framework to support distributed and multi-agent systems
    \item Developing specialized tools for verifying stability and safety properties in complex node graphs
    \item Creating a visual programming interface for intuitive system design
    \item Expanding the library of pre-built nodes for common control and learning components
\end{itemize}

By pursuing these directions, we aim to further enhance the framework's capabilities and facilitate broader adoption in both research and practical applications.

\subsection{Broader Impact}
The Regelum framework represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between classical control theory and modern learning approaches. By providing a unified platform that supports both methodologies, we enable several key advancements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross-disciplinary collaboration} between control theorists and machine learning researchers, fostering innovation at the intersection of these fields
    \item \textbf{Accelerated development cycles} through component reuse and modular design, allowing faster iteration on novel control strategies
    \item \textbf{Enhanced reproducibility in research} through an open-source implementation with transparent numerical methods, addressing a critical need in the scientific community
    \item \textbf{Simplified transition from theory to practice} via the unified simulation and deployment interfaces, reducing the barriers to real-world implementation
\end{itemize}

As control systems become increasingly central to critical infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and advanced robotics, frameworks like Regelum that enable both high performance and formal guarantees will play an essential role in developing the next generation of safe, efficient, and adaptive intelligent systems.

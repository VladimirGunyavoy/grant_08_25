abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is the standard approach to infinite-horizon optimal control which usually optimizes a finite initial fragment of the cost function so as to make the problem computationally tractable. Globally optimal controllers are usually found by Dynamic Programming (DP). The computations involved in DP are notoriously hard to perform, especially in online control. Therefore, different approximation schemes of DP, the so-called “critics”, were suggested for infinite-horizon cost functions. This work proposes to incorporate such a critic into dual-mode MPC as a particular means of addressing infinite-horizon optimal control. The proposed critic is based on Q-learning and is used for online approximation of the infinite-horizon cost. Stability of the new approach is analyzed and certain sufficient stabilizing constraints on the critic are derived. A case study demonstrates the applicability.}

Common to all approaches is approximation of the infinite-horizon cost function based on dynamic programming philosophy. Typically, they also require knowledge of a dynamical model of the system. In the current work, application of adaptive dynamic programming to a system whose dynamical model is unknown to the controller is addressed. In order to realize the control algorithm, a model of the system dynamics is estimated with a Kalman filter. A stacked control scheme to boost the controller performance is suggested. The functioning of the new approach was verified in simulation and compared to the baseline represented by gradient descent on the running cost.}

abstract = {Stability of control systems is one of the central subjects in control theory. The classical asymptotic stability theorem states that the norm of the residual between the state trajectory and the equilibrium is zero in the limit. Unfortunately, it does not in general allow computing a rate of convergence, whereas proving exponential stability is notoriously complicated. This work proposes to revisit the asymptotic stability theory with the aim of computing convergence rates using constructive analysis which is a mathematical tool that realizes equivalence between certain theorems and computational algorithms. The overall goal of the current study matches with the trend for introducing formal verification tools into control theory. Besides existing approaches, constructive analysis, suggested within this work, can also be considered for formal verification of control systems. A computational example is provided that demonstrates extraction of a convergence certificate for a dynamical system.}

abstract = {The major elements of a mobile machine – engine and drives – are a crucial subject of control. Implementation of electric drives in mobile machinery is an emerging field of research and industry. Apart from conventional mechanical drives, they allow for wide control and power management possibilities. This paper considers a tractor-implement as a mobile power grid and addresses the problem of smart engine power management for sustainable operation by using power feedback of electric drives. The main focus lies in providing stable operation of the electrically driven implement. This is achieved by an engine power reserve dynamically adjusted according to power demands and their rate of change. To quantitatively evaluate the power demands, a supervisor approach based on the fuzzy logic theory is suggested. The supervisor has the structure of the Mamdani fuzzy system and computes the amount of the diesel engine power reserve as output. An adaptively changing power reserve providing sustainable operation is demonstrated in a partially stochastic simulation model of an electrified tractor with a rotary swather.}

abstract = {This work has the goal of briefly surveying some key stabilization techniques for general nonlinear systems, for which, as it is well known, a smooth control Lyapunov function may fail to exist. A general overview of the situation with smooth and nonsmooth stabilization is provided, followed by a concise summary of basic tools and techniques, including general stabilization, sliding-mode control and nonsmooth backstepping. Their presentation is accompanied with examples. The survey is concluded with some remarks on computational aspects related to determination of sampling times and control actions.}
